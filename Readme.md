Please download the DATA folder (processed Extended Cohn Kanade Database)
from https://goo.gl/Wvfndv (Dropbox) or https://goo.gl/zt89pE (Google Drive)
and place it inside icassp15 folder. In case you cannot access Dropbox or Google Drive, please download the CK+ dataset from
http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/ and crop the faces using a detector such as Viola-Jones.

The program is developed on Windows. Except directory access issues such as '/' or '\', 'ls' or 'dir' and so on, the program should be able to easily migarated to Linux. For details of the model and the algorithm, please refer to the paper available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1606} or drop me a message. You are more than welcome to cite this work as
